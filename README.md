# Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using machine learning techniques. The Iris dataset, widely known in data science, forms the basis for this project. It contains 150 samples, each represented by four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features are used to predict the species of the iris flowers, making this a multi-class classification problem.

We leverage several machine learning algorithms in this project, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to find the best-performing model. The dataset is loaded, split into training and testing sets, and processed through these models to compare their performance. The project also includes data visualization techniques using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, which help explore the relationships between the features and classes before building models.

To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. You can run the Python script `iris_classification.py` directly to load the data, train the model, and view the classification results, or use a Jupyter notebook for an interactive exploration of the dataset and model building process.

This project demonstrates the entire workflow of building a machine learning classification model—from loading and visualizing data to evaluating different models and choosing the best one based on performance metrics like accuracy. The best-performing model, which in this case was the Decision Tree Classifier, achieved a high accuracy score of 97% on the test set.
